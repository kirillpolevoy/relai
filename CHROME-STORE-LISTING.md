## Copy Doctor Analysis

### Before/After Examples

**❌ Before (Generic):**
"Relai is a powerful Chrome extension that allows users to seamlessly bridge conversations between different AI assistants, making it easy to get second opinions and maintain context across platforms."

**✅ After (Copy Doctor):**
"Transfer conversations between AI platforms instantly."

**Why:**
- Cut 27 words to 6
- Active verb (Transfer)
- Specific outcome (instantly)
- Removed: "powerful", "allows users to", "seamlessly", "making it easy"

### Key Improvements Applied

1. **Active Language**
   - "Transfer conversations" not "allows users to transfer"

   - ❌ "seamlessly bridge"
   - ❌ "easy to use"

3. **Specific, Not Vague**

4. **Numbered Workflow**
   - ① ② ③ ④ for scannable steps
   - No walls of text

5. **Show Benefits, Not Features**
   - "Switch AIs without re-explaining" (benefit)
   - Not: "Stores conversation history" (feature)
